# Vehicle Registration System - Frontend Part

- It is a web application project which is developed by using Java and React. In this project, user can sign up, login, update password, make a list of his/her cars, add/delete/update/read the list and see count of cars he/she owns. 

- This repository is frontend part of a fullstack web application project. I made this project as a final project in software development training held by [@Patika.Dev](https://www.patika.dev/tr) and try to use what I have learned in this training. [@Backend](https://github.com/elifintizamoglu/VehicleRegistrationSystem) part of the project is here.

## What technologies are used while developing frontend?

- I used React and Bootstrap for styling purposes. I developed this project on Visual Studio Code.


## Install and Run the Project

- After pulling this repository, you will need IDE. Install node.js, and project dependencies. After that, you can use **npm start SignUp.js** to start the project. Keep in mind that this project will fail without backend part because they are connected and frontend sends requests to backend.
